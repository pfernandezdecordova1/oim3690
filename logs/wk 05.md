## What I learned This Week.
## Tuesday class- There has been no class. Presidents Weekend. 
## Thursday class
We did the quiz. 
- we worked on the s09 html file. On the same demo file we had last week but we added css to it.
- what does cascading mean? It means that the order of the css matters. If you have two rules that apply to the same element, the one that is defined last will take precedence. we used this in cssstyles and html. 

# Code i am proud of: 
- I added class Yellow to the code and also in the css to make the background yellow. I am proud of this because i was able to do it by myself and understand how to do it.


## Challenges I faced 
- I struggled through the quiz in the question about accebility question and the babson logo one. 
- I struggled to add css and know the steps to do it. 
- I also need to work on the code itself, i need to understand better how to write it and the structure of it.

## Ai Usage? 


## Questions? 



## What do i need to do for next week?

For the Project: 
- Read the mini projects that are on canvas and start thinking about which one i want to do.
- build website for someone else. ( try to use AI)
- new public repository for the project. Project name etc...

- Practice the code and understand better how to write it. Go over questions i got wrong in quiz and understand why.
