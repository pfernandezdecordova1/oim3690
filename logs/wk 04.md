- <br> is used to add a breaker to move the text to the next line.
- <hr> is to create a horizontal line.

## Code im proud of 
<li><a href="https://pfernandezdecordova1.github.io/">My Personal Website</a></li>


## Challenges I faced 
The link did was linking to a file instead of the external website. 

## Ai Usage? 
To answer some of the questions i Had during class. 
Adding Tags to s07. Prompt: I am a biginner and can you add a code with different tags so i can play with them. 

## I gave him this prompt to improve my about me website: 

check the spelling in the profile section. Also at the end add a message that says: Thank You For Your Time! 

Also i need you to add one picture about padel as a sport: you can use this image: https://i.natgeofe.com/n/68f69f0a-9ead-4fda-a9d4-494df610501b/GettyImages-1423558556.jpg

Furthermore under this image add this paragraph: Keep the spaces and everything so it looks organized. And i added the text so he could copy past it. 

## Questions? 
a href? Answer from AI: It tells the browser where the link should go when someone clicks it.
Can you create a vertical line?
