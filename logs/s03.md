We started taking about what is a website in class. 
Web App: lets you do things. Interact. ex: google docs

- Right click on any website, view page source, you can see the code that creates the website.
- DNS: Domain Name System, it translates the domain name to an IP address.
    Computers use Ip adresses. 

- HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language, it is the code that creates the structure of the website.
     The common ones are GET (retrieve) and POST (send data to server).
- Server response codes: 200 is ok, 404 is file not found, 500 is server error.
-CSS: Apply styles.
