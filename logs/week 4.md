## Code im proud of 
<li><a href="https://pfernandezdecordova1.github.io/">My Personal Website</a></li>


## Challenges I faced 
The link did was linking to a file instead of the external website. 

## Ai Usage? 
To answer some of the questions i Had during class. 
Adding Tags to s07. Prompt: I am a biginner and can you add a code with different tags so i can play with them. 

## Questions? 
a href? Answer from AI: It tells the browser where the link should go when someone clicks it.
Can you create a vertical line?
