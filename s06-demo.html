                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>I am a 22-year-old Spanish student who transferred to Babson College two years ago. I am now a senior with a Finance concentration and I am a U.S. citizen.</p>

                <p>I believe web creation is an essential skill for any entrepreneur. I also think that understanding and using AI tools has become increasingly necessary in today’s business landscape.</p>

                <p>As a Babson student, I combine business strategy with practical technical skills to prepare for launching ventures and building products.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>I like to play golf. I used to play a lot of tennis, but I got bored as I grew up, so now I spend my time playing padel, which I find much more fun.</p>

                                    <p>Keep the spaces and everything so it looks organized.</p>

                                    <p>I am very into padel and I'm going to share with you a personal anecdote about my grandmother's brother.</p>

                                    <p>Prince Alfonso was in Acapulco visiting his good friend Enrique Corcuera, who was passionate about the native sport of padel. Enrique didn’t have much space to build a proper court, so he improvised and slightly modified the design by adding walls around his version to stop the ball from getting lost in the nearby bushes. Those walls quickly became a fun feature of the game, providing surfaces from which the ball could be bounced.</p>

                                    <p>Enrique invited the prince to play, and Alfonso was instantly smitten. The more he played, the more convinced he became that this was too good not to share. When he returned to Spain in 1974, he built the first two courts at the Marbella Club Hotel — an establishment frequented by kings and celebrities.</p>

                                    <p>Film stars such as Brigitte Bardot, Audrey Hepburn, Kim Novak, James Stewart and Sean Connery were among the hotel's guests, as well as members of European aristocracy like Grace Kelly. Everyone who tried the game fell in love with it, and padel quickly became the fashionable new sport of the jet-set. It was an instant hit and soon grew into the global phenomenon we know today.</p>
